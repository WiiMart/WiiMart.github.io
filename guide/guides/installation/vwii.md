# vWii
This guide will be for **vWii** users!  *(aka Wii U)*

## Pre-requisites:

- [A modded Wii U console](https://wii.hacks.guide)
- [Priiloader Installer](https://oscwii.org/library/app/priiloader)
- [Load Priiloader](https://oscwii.org/library/app/LoadPriiloader)
- [Yet Another WAD Manager ModMii Edition (YAWM ModMii Edition)](https://oscwii.org/library/app/yawmME)
- [Patched IOS56 for vWii](https://wiimart.org/wad/IOS56(vWii).wad)
- [WiiMart](http://wiimart.org/wad/WiiMart.wad) OR [WiiMart (Old Banner)](http://wiimart.org/wad/WiiMartOB.wad)[^1]

## SD Card

On your SD Card, there are a few files you need to put. Such as the wads for our patched IOS 56 and WiiMart.

1. First, download Priiloader Installer and Load Priiloader. Priiloader is required to make installed apps work.
2. On your SD Card, go to your `apps` folder and drag and drop Yet Another Wad Manager Mod Mii Edition (YAWM Mod Mii Edition); Priiloader Installer and Load Priiloader.
3. Still on your SD Card, create a folder called "wads" if it doesn't already exists. Then, drag and drop the patched IOS56 and WiiMart wads.
4. Safely eject the SD Card and put it back in your console

> [!WARNING]
> If you have a macOS installation, STOP!! There is a Terminal command you need to run to "clean" your SD Card from files called "Archive Bits". They are problematic in terms of Homebrew. In your terminal, simply run the command `dot_clean /Volumes/[Your SD Card's name]` and wait for the process to be finished. Then, you can put the SD Card back in your console.

## Wii U (vWii)

6. Go to System Menu Hacks and enable the `Region Free EVERYTHING` hack, `Permanent vWii settings`, `Wii System Settings via Options Button` and `Always enable WiiConnect24 on boot`.
7. Go all the way down and save settings. Go to System Menu.
8. Once in the vWii System Menu, go to settings. You will normally see a page that **ISN'T** the save's page. This is normal.

13. Go back to the main menu and press HOME (it says it will restart your "wii" but it actually brings you back to the HBC)
14. Press HOME again and go back to System Menu.
