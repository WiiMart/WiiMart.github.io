## What is WiiMart Old Banner?

## I have \*this\* error? What should I do?
Look it up on our (in WIP) error checking tool! https://wiimart.org/errors or ask in #support on our [discord server!](https://discord.gg/wiimart)

## Why did the gift options disappear?
Sadly WiiLink does not approve of it and asked us to take it down. We nicely did. Please, do not harass WiiLink's staff or our staff about it or you will not be allowed on our server again (Banning your Wii's IP).

## Do I need real money to buy WiiPoints?
Absolutely not! Well, you will "purchase" them but no debit/credit card will actually be used. It's purely for nostalgia and trying to replicate Nintendo's structure to avoid errors.

In WiiMart, go to Settings and Features > (You will need to scroll down) Change Region > Select your region
